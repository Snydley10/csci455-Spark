# csci455-Spark
This project implements a Spark MapReduce program to analyze biological interaction data obtained from chromosome regions. The input file, named "interactions," contains pairs of chromosome regions with their corresponding coordinates. The goal is to count the number of interactions falling into specific bin pairs after dividing each chromosome into continuous disjoint bins.
